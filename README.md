## Tuition System

A simple project that has two main components:
* Students
* Teachers

How this platform works is that it allows:
* **Students** to **search** for teachers they want to study under
* **Teachers** to **search** for students that match their teaching skills and/or criteria

There is also a small survey system that allows students to rate the teachers they studied under, 
so that future students can get an idea of what each teacher has to offer. 

The rates of the teachers can be pre defined by the teachers themselves, and the students can also 
have a specific rate wihin which they can search for a teacher.

Students and teachers can also negotiate to a common fee before taking up the job.

We have used a third party library to display the results of the surveys from the different students
the teachers spent their time with.
